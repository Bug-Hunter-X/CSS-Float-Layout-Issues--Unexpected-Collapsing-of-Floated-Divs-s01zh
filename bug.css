The following CSS code snippet causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This seemingly simple code can lead to unexpected layouts if not carefully managed.  The `float: left;` property can cause the div to collapse unexpectedly.  The issue arises when the total width of floated elements exceeds the parent container's width.
