The following CSS code demonstrates a solution by adding a clearfix:

```css
div.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

Alternatively, you can use other methods to clear floats, such as adding the `overflow: auto;` property to the parent container.
